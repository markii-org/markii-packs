/**
 * Walks `node` collecting plain text (strings and numbers), recursing into
 * arrays and into an element's own `children` prop, up to `MAX_DEPTH`
 * levels and `budget.remaining` characters. `children` here is rendered
 * React content, not raw markdown, so it can be an arbitrary element tree;
 * this only ever reads `props.children` and `props['data-mk-name']`, never
 * touches an unknown prop, and every branch is a plain type check, so
 * nothing here can throw on its own, but the caller still wraps the whole
 * walk in a try/catch as defense against a future change to this function.
 *
 * One quirk of the format matters here. A colon inside a text directive's
 * bracket text starts ANOTHER text directive, so `:read_at[12:34]` does
 * not parse as the text "12:34": it parses as the text "12" followed by a
 * nested directive named "34". Reading only the strings would silently
 * show "12" and drop half the timestamp, which is exactly the mute
 * failure this project forbids. A directive element carries its written
 * name on `data-mk-name` (the same prop `@markii/react`'s own
 * `readDirectiveChild` reads), so a nested directive is put back as
 * `:<name>` and the timestamp survives. An author can also write
 * `12\:34`, which the parser keeps as literal text; both spellings reach
 * this function as the same string.

 * nested directive the parser makes of a colon (see that function), so a
 * timestamp written the natural way survives. The text is parsed as
 * `mm:ss` or `hh:mm:ss`; an unparseable timestamp still renders (as the
 * literal text, falling back to `--:--` when there is no text at all)
 * since the displayed text is never withheld.
 *
 * A page reference is the other thing people write here: `p. 42`, `p.42`,
 * `page 42`, or a bare `42`. Text that is not a timestamp is tried as one
 * of those, which is unambiguous because a timestamp always has a colon
 * in it and a page reference never does.
 *
 * `href` becomes a link only when it parses as a safe `http:`/`https:`
 * URL. What gets appended to that URL depends on which reading the text
 * produced. A timestamp appends its seconds as `t=<seconds>` in the query
 * string, replacing any existing `t` and preserving the rest. A page
 * reference sets the URL fragment to `#page=42`, the convention a PDF
 * viewer reads, replacing any fragment the `href` already carried. An
 * unsafe or unparseable `href` renders a plain unlinked chip; a safe
 * `href` whose text is neither reading still links, just unannotated. The
 * chip's own text is always what the author wrote, never the rewritten
 * form.
