 * The label can be written either way. Bracket content wins when it is
 * there, since it is the closest thing to the text; otherwise the `name`
 * attribute is used, and with neither the row still renders as a quiet
 * "Untitled topic" placeholder rather than collapsing to an empty rule.
 *
 * `confidence` runs from 1 to 5 and is clamped into that range, so a
 * stray `confidence=9` reads as full confidence instead of vanishing.
 * A value that is not a number at all (a word, a bare attribute) omits
 * the dots entirely: "no rating yet" and "rated zero" are different
 * things, and guessing between them would be a quiet lie.
