/**
 * Shared defensive helpers for the `prep` pack, following the same shape
 * as `packs/tech/guard.ts`.
 *
 * Most of `prep`'s components read nothing but attributes: an interview
 * question, a confidence rating, and a pitfall note are all typed into
 * the note by hand. Attributes arrive as untrusted strings (or `null` for
 * a bare attribute), so every attribute read goes through one of the
 * first helpers below. A missing, oversized, or nonsense value degrades
 * to a quiet default rather than throwing.
 *
 * `prep_quiz` is the one component here that reads a bound `data=` value,
 * which a script produced and which can be anything at all, including a
 * revoked `Proxy` or an object whose getters throw. The helpers at the
 * bottom (`safeExtract`, `failureTitle`, `stateClassName`, `isUnreadable`)
 * are the same shape `packs/dash` and `packs/track` use for that, so the
 * three packs guard a binding the same way.
